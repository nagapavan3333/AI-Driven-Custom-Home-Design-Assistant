Project Description:

The Custom Home Design Creator project focuses on developing an AI-powered tool for generating personalized home design plans. The objective is to build a generative model that creates custom home layouts based on user inputs such as preferences, spatial requirements, and architectural styles. By analyzing these inputs, the model produces detailed and aesthetically pleasing home designs that align with the user’s vision and functional needs. This tool aims to simplify the home design process, allowing users to explore and visualize their ideal living spaces efficiently, while providing a creative and personalized approach to home planning and design.



Scenario 1: Real Estate Development

In a real estate development firm, the goal is to offer potential buyers customized home designs based on their preferences. Clients input their desired features, such as the number of bedrooms, architectural style, and special amenities. The Custom Home Design Creator generates personalized home layouts that match these specifications. This approach helps clients visualize their ideal homes and enhances their purchasing experience, similar to how tailored property showcases can drive interest and sales.



Scenario 2:Home Renovation Services

For a home renovation company, the tool is used to create design proposals for clients looking to remodel their existing homes. Users provide details about their current space, renovation goals, and style preferences. The Custom Home Design Creator then generates updated design plans that reflect these inputs, helping clients visualize potential changes. This facilitates the decision-making process and allows for more informed planning, akin to how virtual staging is used in real estate.



Scenario 3:Architectural Firm

In an architectural firm, the tool is utilized to quickly generate preliminary design concepts for clients based on their input. Architects and clients collaborate by specifying requirements such as room layout, design aesthetics, and functional needs. The Custom Home Design Creator produces detailed design drafts that can be refined further. This accelerates the design process
 and provides a clear starting point for discussions, similar to how initial sketches are used in architectural planning.

**Project Flow**
1. User Input via Streamlit UI:

Users input a prompt (e.g., topic, keywords) and specify parameters such as the desired length, tone, or style through the Streamlit interface.

2. Backend Processing with Generative AI Model:

The input data is sent to the backend, where it interfaces with the selected Generative AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, etc.).

The model processes the input, generating text based on the specified parameters and user input.

3. Content Generation:

The AI model autonomously creates content tailored to the user’s specifications. This could be a blog post, poem, article, or any other form of text.

4. Return and Display Generated Content:

The generated content is sent back to the frontend for display on the Streamlit app.

The app presents the content to the user in an easily readable format.

5. Customization and Finalization:

Users can further customize the generated content through the Streamlit UI if desired. This might include editing text, adjusting length, or altering tone.

6. Export and Usage:


Once satisfied, users can export or copy the content for their use, such as saving it to a file or directly sharing it.
