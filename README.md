Project Description:

The Custom Home Design Creator project focuses on developing an AI-powered tool for generating personalized home design plans. The objective is to build a generative model that creates custom home layouts based on user inputs such as preferences, spatial requirements, and architectural styles. By analyzing these inputs, the model produces detailed and aesthetically pleasing home designs that align with the userâ€™s vision and functional needs. This tool aims to simplify the home design process, allowing users to explore and visualize their ideal living spaces efficiently, while providing a creative and personalized approach to home planning and design.



Scenario 1: Real Estate Development

In a real estate development firm, the goal is to offer potential buyers customized home designs based on their preferences. Clients input their desired features, such as the number of bedrooms, architectural style, and special amenities. The Custom Home Design Creator generates personalized home layouts that match these specifications. This approach helps clients visualize their ideal homes and enhances their purchasing experience, similar to how tailored property showcases can drive interest and sales.



Scenario 2:Home Renovation Services

For a home renovation company, the tool is used to create design proposals for clients looking to remodel their existing homes. Users provide details about their current space, renovation goals, and style preferences. The Custom Home Design Creator then generates updated design plans that reflect these inputs, helping clients visualize potential changes. This facilitates the decision-making process and allows for more informed planning, akin to how virtual staging is used in real estate.



Scenario 3:Architectural Firm

In an architectural firm, the tool is utilized to quickly generate preliminary design concepts for clients based on their input. Architects and clients collaborate by specifying requirements such as room layout, design aesthetics, and functional needs. The Custom Home Design Creator produces detailed design drafts that can be refined further. This accelerates the design process and provides a clear starting point for discussions, similar to how initial sketches are used in architectural planning.
